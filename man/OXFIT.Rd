\details{
Faecal samples and other blood tests from routine primary care practice in Oxfordshire, UK between March 2017 and March 2020. FIT was analysed using the HM-JACKarc FIT method. Patients were followed for up to 36 months in linked hospital records for evidence of benign and serious colrectal disease (e.g. colorectal cancer, high-risk adenomas, and bowel inflammation).}

This is a synthetic data set generated from the original data set and therefore does not contain actual patient data, only data from simulated patients that share similar attributes to those of the original cohort.
